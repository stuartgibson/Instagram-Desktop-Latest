Instagram Desktop Latest
========================

This is a quick and dirty script that accesses your Instagram feed (you and
those you follow) and redirects to the URL for the latest photo. By pointing
something like [GeekTool](http://projects.tynsoe.org/en/geektool/) at the page
you can have an updating picture on your desktop.

Requirements
------------
A PHP server (local or remote) and an Instagram account.

Installation
------------
Edit the file to use your own [access token](http://blog.pixelunion.net/instagram).  
Edit the file to point to an image to use in the case of an error.  
Upload the index.php file to your server.
If you want to use GeekTool, create a new “image” entry and point
it to the URL of where you uploaded the page.
